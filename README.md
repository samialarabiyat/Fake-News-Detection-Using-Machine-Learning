Fake News Detection Using NLP and Deep Learning
This project implements a Fake News Detection System using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning Models. The dataset consists of real and fake news articles, and various models such as LSTM, GRU, Flatten, and Conv1D are trained to classify the news as real or fake.
Project Overview
Preprocesses news articles using tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
Converts text data into numeric sequences using Tokenization.
Trains multiple deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, CNN, and Dense) to compare performance.
Evaluates model performance using accuracy, loss, and confusion matrices.
